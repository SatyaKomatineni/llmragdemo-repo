# Chromadb set: 1/29/24
******************************************************
Main Goal:
1. install it (complete)
2. store text
3. Retrieve text

Store/retrieve
******************************************************
1. locate chromadb docs
2. getting started page

requirements:

I need help with python code to work with chromadb. the details are below:

1. write me python code for chromadb to store and retrieve text segments
2. I want to use a local file to store the database
3. I want to use the builtin vectorizer
4. Show me what I need to import
5. Make the code modularized and keep it in well organized functions

# Work with Shakespeare data set

Write me 3 python functions.

The first one. Write me a python function that does the following

1. retrieves and installs a Shakespeare data set
2. Parses the data set into a dictionary with the following keys and values
    3. Sonnet number is the key
    4. Sonnet english text is the value (as a string)
5. return that dictionary as an output of the function
6. Choose an appropriate library to do this
7. Also include in your advise what needs to be imported and how to download the dataset

Then write me a second function to do the following

1. Take the dictionary from the previous function as an input
2. Use chromadb as a persistent client
3. Save the sonnet text as a text input so that chromadb can store its embeddings so the sonnet can be retrieved later via a vector search
4. Store the sonnet number as the metadata in 2 fields both as an integer and a string like "Sonnet 17" while saving it in chromadb
5. Write a test function to count the number of sonnets stored in chromadb
6. Advise any necessary imports and downloads

Then write me a third function to do the following

1. Given a text query locate the matching sonnets and return them as a dictionary of sonnet number and the sonnet
3. Write a test function to test it with the following test query "Locate Sonnet 17 for me"


Try 2
************************
Write me a python function that does the following

1. retrieves and installs a Shakespeare data set using nltk and nltk.download
2. Parses the data set into a dictionary with the following keys and values
    3. Sonnet number is the key
    4. Sonnet english text is the value (as a string)
5. return that dictionary as an output of the function
6. Choose an appropriate library to do this
7. Also include in your advise what needs to be imported and how to download the dataset


validation stuff
*************************
write me a function to validate the input parameters so that they are not null or empty strings

1. Should take multiple args
2. validate each org so that it is not
    3. not null or none
    4. if it is a string object it is not an empty string
5. if any org fails raise an exception as follows
    6. "The specified Argument x cannot be null or empty" where the "x" is the name of the argument


Examine a string
**********************
write me a function to examine large strings

1. Take 2 inputs, the text string and max length to display
2. Report if the string is empty or none
3. Report the size of the string
4. Report first "max_length" characters of the string


Extract sonnets
********************

Can you write code with regex in python for the following

1. to extract the list of text segments that are between the lines of roman numerals as shown in the example below
2. replace the roman numeral with "Sonnet X" where X is the number representing the roman numeral
3. There can be as many as 200 segments like this

The Example large text string follows:

I

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

II

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

III

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

Regex
**************

I need some help with regex.

Consider the following text in double quotes:


"
I

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

II

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

III

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

"
I want a regular expression that matches the lines 
a. that have single words in them 
b. Those words are a roman numeral
c. The roman numerals may be as large as 150 or more
d. It is quite ok if they match approximately as long as they are the only word on that line
